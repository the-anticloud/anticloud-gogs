## 🔮 Vision

The Gogs (`/gɑgz/`) project aims to build a simple, stable and extensible self-hosted Git service that can be set up in the most painless way. With Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across all platforms that Go supports, including Linux, macOS, Windows and ARM-based systems.

## 📡 Overview

- Please visit [our home page](https://gogs.io) for user documentation.
- Please refer to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for list of changes in each releases.
- Want to try it before doing anything else? Do it [online](https://try.gogs.io/gogs/gogs)!
- Having trouble? Help yourself with [troubleshooting](https://gogs.io/asking/troubleshooting) or ask questions in [Discussions](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/discussions).
- Want to help with localization? Check out the [localization documentation](https://gogs.io/advancing/localization).
- Ready to get hands dirty? Read our [contributing guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Hmm... What about APIs? We have experimental support with [documentation](https://gogs.io/api-reference).

## 💌 Features

- User dashboard, user profile and activity timeline.
- Access projects via SSH, HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
- User, organization and project management.
- project and organization webhooks, including Slack, Discord and Dingtalk.
- project Git hooks, deploy keys and Git LFS.
- project issues, pull requests, wiki, protected branches and collaboration.
- Migrate and mirror projects with wiki from other code hosts.
- Web editor for quick editing project files and wiki.
- Jupyter Notebook and PDF rendering.
- Authentication via SMTP, LDAP, reverse proxy, GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise with 2FA.
- Customize HTML templates, static files and many others.
- Rich database backend support, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3 or any database backend that speaks one of those protocols.
- Have localization over [31 languages](https://crowdin.com/project/gogs).

## 💾 Hardware requirements

- A Raspberry Pi or $5 Digital Ocean Droplet is more than enough to get you started. Some even use 64MB RAM Docker [CaaS](https://www.docker.com/blog/containers-as-a-service-caas/).
- 2 CPU cores and 512MB RAM would be the baseline for teamwork.
- Increase CPU cores when your team size gets significantly larger, memory footprint remains low.

## 💻 Browser support

- Please see [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI#browser-support) for specific versions of supported browsers.
- The smallest resolution officially supported is **1024*768**, however the UI may still look right in smaller resolutions, but no promises or fixes.

## Contributing

*Excerpt from upstream `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`:*

# Welcome to Gogs contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our projects!

Read our [Code of Conduct](https://go.dev/conduct) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon <img src="https://github.com/github/docs/raw/50561895328b8f369694973252127b7d93899d83/assets/images/table-of-contents.png" width="25" height="25" /> on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](/README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)

In addition to the general guides with open source contributions, you would also need to:

- Have basic knowledge about web applications development, database management systems and programming in [Go](https://go.dev/).
- Have a working local development setup with a reasonable good IDE or editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go), [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) or [Vim](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go).
- [Set up your development environment](/docs/dev/local_development.md).

## Issues

### Ask for help

Before opening an issue, please make sure the problem you're encountering isn't already addressed on the [Troubleshooting](https://gogs.io/asking/troubleshooting) and [FAQs](https://gogs.io/asking/faq) pages.

### Create a new issue

- For questions, ask in [Discussions](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/discussions).

## Benchmarks

Measured by the Anticloud assurance suite. Every value below is read from this
project's `BENCH.json`, produced by a real run — the SHA3-256 of that file is
`45356fa59f9f81a3981b9e516a345aebacb30d327b9e52ddd0a03df68fa3b481`.

| Framework | Controls | Evidence | Coverage | Result |

| OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications | 10 controls mapped | 10 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| OWASP Top 10 (2021) | 9 controls mapped | 9 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| SOC 2 Type II readiness | 9 controls mapped | 9 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| NIST AI Risk Management Framework | 8 controls mapped | 8 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |
| NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 | 12 controls mapped | 12 with evidence | 100.0% | PASS |

**Overall: 16/16 checks passing.**

See `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/03_Result_Register.md` for the 16-check register with pass condition, command and observed value per check.

Framework folders in `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` state the control set and the
evidence source bound to each control. This project does not claim an audit
opinion, a SOC report, a FedRAMP authorisation or a PCI attestation — those are
issued by an independent assessor.
